Fallacies of distributed systems:

1. Network is reliable
2. Latency is zero
3. Bandwidth is infinite
4. Network is secure
5. Transport cost is zero
6. Network is homogeneous (runs on same hardware/vendor)
7. Network topology never changes
8. There is only one network administrator

Drawbacks of distributed systems:

Logging is harder
Eventual consistency is hard and required
Contract maintenance and versioning is required
