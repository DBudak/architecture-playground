Also called "Orchestrated saga", is a traditional saga, as most people understand it

The goal is to mimic the monolith service behavior

Orchestrator manages workflow. In case of failure it issues compensating transactions.

Pros
    As close to atomicity as one can get as it exists in monolith services
Cons
    Negative impact on performance, scale, elasticity
    Compensating transactions succumb to wide variety of failure modes and require manual intervention

Qualities
    Communication               Synchronous
    Consistency                 Atomic
    Coordination                Orchestrated
    Coupling                    Very high
    Complexity                  Low
    Responsiveness/availability Low
    Scale/elasticity            Very low
