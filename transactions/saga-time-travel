Synchronous, eventual consistency, choreographed

Each service accepts requests, performs action, forwards to the next actor.
Is usually an implementation of Chain of Responsibilities design pattern (workflow with one way steps)
Each domain deals with error conditions separately

As any other choreography is not fit for complex workflows

Works well for high throughput flows

Is an easier alternative to Anthology Saga. If pattern provides adequate scalability, teams don't have to embrace
more complex workflow
