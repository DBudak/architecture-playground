Worst possible combination
Asynchronous communication, atomic consistency, choreographed coordination

Combines the most stringent coupling for consistency with the loosest coupling styles: asynchronous choreography

Is usually a result of architect attempting to improve performance in a saga by introducing asynchronous communication
