An Epic saga with choreography instead of orchestration

No formal orchestrator exists. Initially called service becomes coordination point (sometimes called front controller)

If an error occurs each service must have built-in compensating requests to send up the chain

For complex workflows, the coordinator will become as complex as any orchestrator.

Use for simple workflows, to eliminate race conditions
