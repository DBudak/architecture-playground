SOAP - Simple Object Access Protocol

Is a message protocol that enables the distributed elements of an application to communicate. SOAP can be carried over
a variety of standard protocols, including the web-related Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

SOAP is a lightweight protocol used to create web APIs, usually with Extensible Markup Language (XML). It supports a
wide range of communication protocols across the internet, HTTP, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) and
Transmission Control Protocol.

The SOAP Envelope encapsulates all the data in a message and identifies the XML document as a SOAP message.
The Header element contains additional information about the SOAP message. This information could be authentication
credentials, for example, which are used by the calling application.
The Body element includes the details of the actual message that need to be sent from the web service to the calling
application. This data includes call and response information.


REST - Representational State Transfer

Is a software architecture style for building scalable web services. REST services typically communicate via HTTP and
are built using XML and JSON.

REST is far more common of the two types of service, as it is more flexible (permitting more data formats, while SOAP
only allows for XML) and uses standard HTTP. RESTful reads can also be cached, while SOAP reads cannot.


gRPC - gRPC Remote Procedure Calls

Is a cross-platform open source high performance remote procedure call (RPC) framework.

GraphQL is used by distributed architectures to provide read-only aggregated data.
