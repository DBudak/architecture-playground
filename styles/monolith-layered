MVC
This is where you end up with no architect
Evolves into Big Ball of Mud
Favors Technical Partitioning

Layers:
    Presentation
    Business rules
    Service
    Persistence
    Database

Good:
    Cheap
    Devs know it
    Easy RBAC
Bad:
    Not scalable
    Not testable
    No fault tolerance
    No modularity
    No deployability

Anti pattern:
    Architecture sinkhole - too many pass-through requests in a layered monolith

Start with this if need fast and cheap. Switch to something else if grows.
