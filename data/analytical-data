Analytical and operation data needs are different

Data Warehouse
    Data is extracted from many sources into one massive storage (warehouse)
    Data is transformed into a single schema
    Regular sync mechanism is present
    Analysis is done against warehouse data
    Has SQL-ish interfaces
Pros
    Centralized consolidation of data
    Isolated analysis silo
Cons
    Extreme partitioning of domain knowledge
    Integration brittleness
    Complexity
    Limited functionality for intended purposes


Data Lake
    Data is extracted from many sources into one massive storage (warehouse)
    Data is not transformed, or transformation is minimal
    Regular sync mechanism is present
    Analysis is done against lake data
Pros
    Less structured than Data Warehouse
    Less up-front transformation
    Better suited to distributed architectures
Cons
    Sometimes difficult to understand relationships
    Requires ad hoc transformations


Data Mesh
    Data is owned by a domain
    Data is a product
    Self-serve data platform
    Computational federated governance
Pros
    Highly suitable for microservices
    Follows modern principles and ilities
    Allows excellent decoupling between analytical and operational data
    Carefully formed contracts allow loosely coupled evolution
Cons
    Requires contract coordination
    Requires asynchronous communication and eventual consistency
