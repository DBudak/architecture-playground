Tactical Forking - copy everything and start deleting
    Pros
        Teams can start working right away with no up-front analysis
        Devs find it easier to delete code rather than extract it
    Cons
        Result will likely still contain a lot of latent code left from the monolith
        Code won't be less chaotic unless refactored, there will be just less of it
        Inconsistencies in naming shared files and components

Identify and Size Components Pattern -typically the first approach
    Useful metric for component sizing - calculate number of statements (ends with ;)
    When resizing a large component - use functional decomposition or domain-driven approaches to identify subdomains
    Implement fitness functions via COTS software, p 87

Gather Common Domain Components Pattern - used to consolidate common business domain that might be duplicated
    Sign that Common DOmain Components exist is the use of shared classes or a common inheritance structure
    Can be automated via a fitness function  to locate common names within the namespace of a component

Flatten Components Pattern - used to collapse or expand domains, subdomains and components, ensuring source code files
reside only within well-defined componentsб з108 ащк учфьзду
    When the namespace of a component gets extended (another node is added to directory structure usually), the prior
    namespace is no longer a component, but a subdomain
    Component is the last thing in the inheritance tree, not first

Determine component Dependencies Pattern - identify and refine dependencies, determine feasibility for a migration
    Analyze incoming and outgoing dependencies to determine resulting service dependency graph
    Component dependency is formed when a class from one component interacts with the class fro mthe other one
    Component coupling is one of the most important factors in determining feasibility of migration

Create Components Domains Pattern - group and refactor components to align with particular domain

Create Domain Services Pattern - physically breaking monolith apart
