Event processor A (1)-> Queue (2)-> Event Processor B (3)-> DB

1. Message never reaches queue
Solution: Persistence message queue + synchronous send = guaranteed delivery.
Save event in db, Event processor A is blocked until queue acknowledged event received

2. B read the event but crashed before processing it
Solution: Client acknowledgment mode. Keep events in queue, attach Cid (client ID). Keep it unique to processor
Arch Foundation book p 202 for detail

3. B unable to presist data
Solution: leverage ACID db transaction via db commit.
Last participant support - remove only after acknowledgment of persistence
