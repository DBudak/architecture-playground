Choreography (no central mediator) works for flows that need
    responsiveness and scalability and don't have complex error scenarios or they are infrequent
    Allows for high throughput
    Can be difficult to implement

Orchestration (central mediator) best suited for complex workflows that include boundary and error conditions
    Doesn't provide as much scale as choreography
