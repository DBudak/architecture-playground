Two components are connascent if a change in one requires the other to be modified

Static connascence - source code level coupling
    Connascence of name - components must agree on the name of the entity
    Connascence of type - e.g. true = 1
    Connascence of meaning
    Connascence of position - order of values
    Connascence of algorithm - e.g. agree on security hashing algo

Dynamic connascence - runtime level coupling
