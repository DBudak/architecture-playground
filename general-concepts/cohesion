Cohesion defines to what extent the parts of the module should be in the module

From good to bad:
    Functional cohesion - essential to function
    Sequential cohesion - output becomes input
    Communicational cohesion - contribute to the same output
    Procedural cohesion - order of execution
    Temporal cohesion - timing dependency
    Logical cohesion - util files
    Coincidental cohesion - not related but coupled
