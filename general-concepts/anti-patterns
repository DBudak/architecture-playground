Architecture sinkhole - too many pass-through requests in a layered monolith

Cyclic dependency - tight coupling of components that also can reference each other

Elephant Migration Antipattern - starting microservice migration small without overall vision. Results in distributed monolith

Stamp-coupling - occurs when modules share a composite data structure and use only parts of it, possibly different parts
