Evans:
Aggregate is a cluster of associated objects that we treat as a unit for purpose of data changes.
Each Aggregate has a root and a boundary
Boundary defines what is inside the aggregate
Root is a single entity contained in the aggregate. Root is the only memeber of Aggregate that outside objects are allowed to hold a reference to
Entities other than the root can have local identities, but it is only distinguishable within the aggregate.
Any object internal to the aggregate can only be accessed by traversal from the Root.

To make an aggregate:
    Cluster Entities and Value objects together. Form Boundary. Pick a Root Entity
    Ensure Aggregate creation methods are atomic and enforces all variances of the Aggregate
