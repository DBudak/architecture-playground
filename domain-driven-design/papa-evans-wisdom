Use code in design
Make all parties involved in the project
Be ready to drop things as you go
Collaboration is the key to successful outcome
Represent business rule as a separate code aka Policy

Give an entity an id only if you care about its identity
If you don't - its a value object, make it immutable
Start modeling from value objects and increase complexity as you go (this is not Evans, this is me)
