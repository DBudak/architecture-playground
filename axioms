Primary business driver for breaking apps into smaller parts is time-to-market

Key business architectural characteristics: time-to-market, agility, fault tolerance, scalability, deployability,
testability, maintainability

Everything is a tradeoff, if you think something is not -- you just haven't uncovered enough information

Every workflow that architect needs to model has semantic coupling -- the inherent coupling that exists in the problem
of the domain. Semantic coupling cannot be reduced. Any coupling on top is called implementation coupling

Architecture patterns are a recognition of commonality of a problem, not its solvability

Reducing coupling increases scale
